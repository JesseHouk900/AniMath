# AniMath

## Goal(s)
  Create an app that allows manipluation and observation of manipulations to equations using basic algebra.

## Purpose
  After many hours of creating stunning animations with MS Powerpoint, fellow developer, Yujin Yoshimura, pitched an idea to our Software Development team to make an app for showing animations on mathematical equations quickly. Expanding from there was easy, as the application could be useful in teaching and reviewing algebra in an educational setting.
